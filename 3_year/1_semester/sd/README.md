# Distributed Systems Course
This folder contains the coursework developed during the Distributed Systems (Sistemas Distribuídos) course at Universidade do Minho.

## Overview
The course focuses on the design and implementation of distributed applications, covering concurrency control, socket programming, synchronization primitives, and fault tolerance. It includes several practical exercises and a final project involving a client-server architecture.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Tools:** Gradle, Sockets, Multi-threading (Locks, Conditions)

## Acknowledgements
The base code for several exercises and the project structure were provided by the teaching staff. My task was to implement the core distributed logic, synchronization mechanisms, and networking protocols.
