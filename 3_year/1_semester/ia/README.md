# Artificial Intelligence Course
This folder contains the work developed during the Artificial Intelligence course at Universidade do Minho.

## Overview
The course covers fundamental AI concepts, including search strategies (Informed and Uninformed), optimization algorithms, and logic programming. Practical work involves implementing search algorithms (A*, BFS, DFS), local search (Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing), and knowledge representation using Prolog.

## Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python, Prolog
* **Topics:** Graph Search, Heuristics, Logic Programming, Constraint Satisfaction.

## Acknowledgements
The project and exercise structures were developed as part of the coursework. Some utility modules and problem specifications were provided by the teaching staff to guide the implementation of AI models and algorithms.
