# Algorithms and Complexity Course

This folder contains the work developed during the Algorithms and Complexity course at Universidade do Minho.

## Overview

The Algorithms and Complexity course delves into computer science essential topics, including sorting algorithms, graph theory, AVL trees, dynamic programming, and computational complexity. The course provides a comprehensive understanding of these fundamental concepts, with a particular focus on advanced data structures and graph-based problem-solving techniques.

## Language Used

The programming language primarily used in this course is C.
