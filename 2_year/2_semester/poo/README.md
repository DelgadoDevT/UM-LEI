# SpotifUM

## Overview

**SpotifUM** is a music management application inspired by Spotify, developed as a project for an Object-Oriented Programming course. Built entirely in **Java**, the application simulates a music platform through a terminal-based interface. It supports user registration, login, music library management, playlists, and admin-level operations.

Although SpotifUM does **not actually play music**, it simulates playback and interactions by printing relevant information to the terminal.
